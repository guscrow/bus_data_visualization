<a href="http://setosa.io/bus/">Click here to see interactive data visualization</a>
<p>In this visualization there are two different interactions that a user can do. One being a click on a bus, which causes it to stop while you are holding down the click.
    This can be achieved using a d3 .on("click,function(d){}) selector. The other interection that the user can do is with the bus stops. If you hover over the bus stop with the mouse.
    It will make a containtly updating graph of the time that the buses spend at that bus stop. This can be achieved using a d3 .on("mouseover",function(d){}).
